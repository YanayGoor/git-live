# git-live
Live dashboard for a git repository

## Why do I need this?

:white_check_mark: No need to run `git status` or `git log` after everything you do

:white_check_mark: Never forget the names of you recently visited branches


## Can I perform git actions through the dashboard?
This dashboard is designed for use in a tmux environment, and therefore can only display information.

## How does it look?
